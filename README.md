# DepthAI Python API Extras

This repo contains the pre-compiled DepthAI Python module (compiled as an architecture-specific `.so` file), utilities, and DepthAI examples.

## Python modules

Files with extention `.so` are python modules:  
- `depthai.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` built for Ubuntu 18.04 & Python 3.6  
- `depthai.cpython-37m-arm-linux-gnueabihf.so` built for Raspbian 10 & Python 3.7  

## Examples

`test.py` - depth example  
`test_cnn.py` - CNN inference example

## Conversion of existing trained models into Intel Movidius binary format
OpenVINO toolkit contains components which allow conversion of existing supported trained `Caffe
and Tensorflow` models into Intel Movidius binary format through the Intermediate Representation
(IR) format.  
Example of the conversion:
1. The  command `<path-to-openvino-folder>/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/python3 mo.py --model_name ResNet50 --output_dir ResNet50_IR_FP16 --framework tf --data_type FP16 --input_model inference_graph.pb` will produce the following contents: `./ResNet50_IR_FP16, ResNet50.bin, ResNet50.mapping, ResNet50.xml.` Where `ResNet50.xml` is a file containing execution graph for this network; `ResNet50.bin` is weights file; and `ResNet50.mapping` contains mapping between layers in original public/custom model and layers within IR.
2. Weights (.bin) and graph (.xml) produced on the previous step will be required for building a blob file.
`myriad_compile` tool comes bundled with OpenVINO package and is used for blob generation. When producing blobs, the following constraints must be applied: `CMX-SLICES = 8 SHAVES = 8 INPUT-FORMATS = 8 OUTPUT-FORMATS= FP16/FP32 (Make changes in host code for meta frame display accordingly).` Example of command execution: `<path-to-openvino-folder>/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/myriad_compile -m ./ResNet50.xml -o ResNet50.blob -ip U8 -VPU_PLATFORM VPU_2480 -VPU_NUMBER_OF_SHAVES 8 -VPU_NUMBER_OF_CMX_SLICES 8`


## Calibration

For better depth image quality, you need a stereo calibration. To do it, you have to:
1. Print the chessboard for calibration. The picture can be found in the `resources` folder (resources/calibration-chess-board.png). Measure the square size in centimeters and insert the value in the command below.
2. Start python3 script: type `python3 calibrate.py -s [SQUARE_SIZE_IN_CM]` in the terminal. Two streams left and right will show up. Each window will contain a polygon.  
3. Put a printed chessboard within the polygon and press barspace. It will take a photo. There will be 13 positions of polygons.  
4. After it, the calibration will automatically start based on taken pictures. If calibration is a successful file named `depthai.calib` will be generated.

Depthai has the default calibration file. There are two ways to change it:

1. Easy way: rename your calibration file to `default.calib` and move it the resources folder.  
2. Harder way: go to the `consts/resource_paths.py` and set the path to your calibration file into `calib_fpath` variable.  

## Issues reporting  

We are developing depthai framework, and it's crucial for us to know what kind of problems users are facing.  
So thanks for testing DepthAI! The information you give us, the faster we will help you and make depthai better!  

Please, do the following steps:  
1. Run script `log_system_information.sh` and provide us the output (`log_system_information.txt`, it's system version & modules versions);  
2. Take a photo of a device you are using (or provide us a device model);  
3. Describe the expected results;  
4. Describe the actual running results (what you see after started your script with depthai);  
5. Provide us information about how you are using the depthai python API (code snippet, for example);  
6. Send us consol outputs;
