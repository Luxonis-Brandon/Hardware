Code samples are used for automated testing. They are also a great starting point for the DepthAI API, as different node functionalities
are presented with code.


.. rubric:: ColorCamera

- :ref:`Auto Exposure on ROI` - Demonstrates how to use auto exposure based on the selected ROI
- :ref:`RGB Camera Control` - Demonstrates how to control the RGB camera (crop, focus, exposure, sensitivity) from the host

.. rubric:: VideoEncoder

- :ref:`RGB Encoding` - Encodes RGB (1080P, 30FPS) into :code:`.h265` and saves it on the host
- :ref:`RGB & Mono Encoding`- Encodes RGB (1080P, 30FPS) and both mono streams (720P, 30FPS) into :code:`.h265`/:code:`.h264` and saves them on the host
